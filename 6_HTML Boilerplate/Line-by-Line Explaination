Hereâ€™s a line-by-line explanation of your HTML code in simple terms:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`  
   - This tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.

2. `<html lang="en">`  
   - This starts the HTML document and specifies that the language is English (`en`).

3. `<head>`  
   - This section contains metadata (information about the webpage) but is not visible on the page.

4. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`  
   - This sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters and symbols.

5. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`  
   - This ensures the webpage scales properly on different screen sizes, like mobile and desktop.

6. `<title>Document</title>`  
   - This sets the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.

7. `</head>`  
   - This closes the head section.

8. `<body>`  
   - This is where all the visible content of the webpage (like text, images, and buttons) goes.

9. `</body>`  
   - This closes the body section.

10. `</html>`  
   - This ends the HTML document.
